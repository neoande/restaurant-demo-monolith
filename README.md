# Order Management System

The Order Management System is a monolithic application designed to handle orders in a restaurant setting. It provides functionality for servers to manage orders, calculate totals, and add tips.

## Application Overview

The Order Management System allows servers to perform the following actions:

- Add items to an order: Servers can add various food items and their quantities to an order.
- Remove items from an order: Servers can remove specific items from an order if needed.
- Calculate the total amount owed: The system automatically calculates the total amount owed based on the prices and quantities of the items in the order.
- Add tips: Servers can add tips to the order, which will be included in the final amount owed.

## Why Monolithic Design?

The application was designed as a monolith to simplify development and deployment. By having all the functionality within a single codebase, it reduces the complexity of managing multiple services or microservices. This design choice also simplifies the deployment process, as the entire application can be deployed as a single unit.

## Pitfalls of Monolithic Design

While monolithic design has its advantages, there are some pitfalls to consider:

1. **Scalability**: Monolithic applications can be challenging to scale horizontally. As the application grows, it may become difficult to handle increased traffic or load. Scaling the entire application can be inefficient and costly.

2. **Maintenance**: With all the functionality tightly coupled, making changes or adding new features can be more complex. A change in one part of the application may require redeploying the entire monolith, leading to longer deployment cycles and potential downtime.

3. **Technology Stack**: Monolithic applications often use a single technology stack, limiting the flexibility to adopt new technologies or frameworks. Upgrading or replacing components may require significant effort and risk.

4. **Testing**: Testing a monolithic application can be challenging due to the tight coupling between components. It may be difficult to isolate and test individual parts of the application, leading to slower test cycles and potential dependencies between tests.

Despite these pitfalls, the monolithic design can be a suitable choice for smaller applications or when simplicity and rapid development are prioritized over scalability and flexibility.

## Improving with Layered Architecture

To address the limitations of the monolithic design, the application can be refactored using a layered architecture. A layered architecture promotes separation of concerns and modularization, making the application more maintainable, scalable, and testable.

The following layers can be considered for the application:

1. **Presentation Layer**: This layer handles user interactions and input/output operations. It can include components such as controllers, views, and user interfaces.

2. **Application Layer**: The application layer contains the business logic and orchestrates the flow of data between different components. It encapsulates use cases and exposes services that can be consumed by the presentation layer.

3. **Domain Layer**: The domain layer represents the core business entities, rules, and behaviors. It should be independent of any specific technology or framework and focus solely on the business domain.

4. **Infrastructure Layer**: The infrastructure layer provides implementations for external dependencies such as databases, external services, or APIs. It also includes components for data access, caching, logging, and other cross-cutting concerns.

By adopting a layered architecture, the application gains several benefits:

- **Modularity**: Each layer can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, allowing for easier collaboration and code reuse.

- **Scalability**: With a modular structure, it becomes easier to scale specific layers or components based on demand. For example, the presentation layer can be scaled separately from the application or infrastructure layers.

- **Flexibility**: The layered architecture enables the use of different technologies or frameworks within each layer. This allows for easier adoption of new tools or migration to newer technologies without affecting the entire application.

- **Testability**: The separation of concerns in a layered architecture makes it easier to write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for each layer independently. This improves the overall test coverage and reduces dependencies between tests.

To implement a layered architecture, consider using design patterns such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), or MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) to structure the different layers and their interactions.
